# ROBLOX-GameAnalytics-API
A basic API to use GameAnalytics in ROBLOX.

This provides a simple interface to initialize a GameAnalytics instance, build
requests, and schedule them to be submitted to the GameAnalytics servers.

The easiest way to use this is to grab the .rbxm file which contains the
GameAnalytics API and everything it requires. For convenience, the source of
the GameAnalytics script alone is provided here.
